# 21 01 11 JS DOM Selectors Practice

## Practice
Add comments throughout the JavaScript file (at minimum). HTML, CSS, and JS files have already been included in the assignment but are not linked. Do not make any changes to the HTML file beyond linking the files. Push after completing each exercise. Comment out any broken code before 9PM submission and provide context on what's not working.

1. Select the assignment title from the dom and output the text only to the console.
1. Create a new class `title` that sets the font to italic. Apply this class to the assignment title using javascript.
1. Select the container div and change the text color inside of the black border to `##DBA159` using javascript.
1. Prompt the user to enter a value then update the text `User Value Here...` to the value entered by the user as an H1 using javascript.

Bonus

Ask the user to confirm if they want to update the text `User Value Here...`. If they choose okay prompt them for new text and update the text displayed to the text entered by the user as an H1. If they choose cancel do nothing.
